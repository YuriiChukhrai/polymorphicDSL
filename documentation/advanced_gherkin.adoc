= Advanced Gherkin

Gherkin has many features people don't know about. You might also
want some help on how to write parsers to enable the advanced
features.

== Sample Gherkin File

The below file demos many of Gherkin's advanced features:

ifndef::env-github[]
[source,gherkin]
----
include::../examples/tutorial/src/test/resources/features/FullGherkinExample.feature[Advanced Gherkin]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
https://github.com/google/polymorphicDSL/blob/main/examples/tutorial/src/test/resources/features/FullGherkinExample.feature[AdvancedGherkin.feature]
endif::[]



== Sample Gherkin Parser

The below lexer and parser shows you how to work with these features:

=== Lexer

ifndef::env-github[]
[source,antlr4]
----
include::../examples/tutorial/src/test/antlr4/com/example/FullGherkinLexer.g4[FullGherkinLexer.g4]
----
endif::[]

ifdef::env-github[]
https://github.com/google/polymorphicDSL/blob/main/examples/tutorial/src/test/antlr4/com/example/FullGherkinLexer.g4[FullGherkinLexer.g4]
endif::[]

=== Parser

ifndef::env-github[]
