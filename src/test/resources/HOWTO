To get a PDSL grammar with all the active rules, do the following:
    antlr4 <someLexer>.g4 -package com.pdsl.grammars
    antlr4 <someParser>.g4 -package com.pdsl.grammars

    Get the .interp file from the above, get the rule names and create a new grammar for it with a "polymorphicDslAllRules" rule
    Make sure to use <someLexer> as your tokenVocab in the PDSL file you create.
		Make sure that the PolymorphicDslAllRules matches one or more instance (rule+)

    antlr4 <yourPDSLParser>
